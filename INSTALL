# Setup

Please look at the config.mk file.  
Included in this file are various configuration options  
which pertain to the use of pstate-frequency.
Enable or disable by choice the use of  

+ debugging messages in program output
+ the use of the msr kernel module to explicitly set
a Turbo Boost bit to ON or OFF
+ a udev rule for dynamic plan setting on power change
+ basic bash completion of options

Other options that may be of interest to the user are  
+ The C compiler to use
+ The location of install

# Building
Once the config.mk file has been setup to user liking,
run the commands

make - to build the pstate-frequency binary
make install - to install the pstate-frequency binary to $PREFIX    
               and the udev and bash completion rules should they  
               be enabled
