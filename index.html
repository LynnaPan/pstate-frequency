<p>For a long time, there was only one main CPU frequency scaling driver for Linux<br>
called acpi-cpufreq. The code was old and many people felt like the commonly used<br>
ondemand governor was not cutting it with modern hardware. Intel stepped up to<br>
create a new CPU driver called intel_pstate which promised more robust control<br>
over CPU P-States and better dynamic scaling.</p>

<p>And when it was introduced there were no programs built to really take advantage<br>
of its new interface (currently housed in /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate).<br>
cpupower existed for earlier acpi-cpufreq machines, but no program existed to<br>
make it convenient to use intel_pstate.</p>

<p>So I built one.<br>
Kind of.</p>

<p>pstate-frequency is a simple program. Its job is to allow users to conveniently<br>
and quickly read and change the values used by the intel_pstate driver. It allows<br>
users to set maximum and minimum frequency ranges, and control the likelyhood of<br>
the CPU to enter Turbo Boost frequencies.</p>

<p>It's not perfect.</p>

<p>Due to bugs in the new intel_pstate driver, frequency ranges may not always be<br>
respected. The driver may not idle at the proper frequencies all the time.<br>
Various bugs can occur.</p>

<p>And that's okay.</p>

<p>pstate-frequency works to deliver convenience, it helps the user configure the 
intel_pstate driver to run as they would like it to. It is a simple program.<br>
It has a simple task and a simple goal.  Written in C, it depends only on the<br>
GNU coreutils and the users ability to read and comprehend the various options<br>
available.</p>
