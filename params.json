  "body": "# pstate-frequency\r\n\r\nFor a long time, there was only one main CPU frequency scaling driver for Linux  \r\ncalled acpi-cpufreq. The code was old and many people felt like the commonly used  \r\nondemand governor was not cutting it with modern hardware. Intel stepped up to  \r\ncreate a new CPU driver called intel_pstate which promised more robust control  \r\nover CPU P-States and better dynamic scaling.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was introduced there were no programs built to really take advantage  \r\nof its new interface (currently housed in /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate).  \r\ncpupower existed for earlier acpi-cpufreq machines, but no program existed to  \r\nmake it convenient to use intel_pstate.\r\n\r\nSo I built one.  \r\nKind of.\r\n\r\npstate-frequency is a simple program. Its job is to allow users to conveniently  \r\nand quickly read and change the values used by the intel_pstate driver. It allows  \r\nusers to set maximum and minimum frequency ranges, and control the likelyhood of  \r\nthe CPU to enter Turbo Boost frequencies.\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect.\r\n\r\nDue to bugs in the new intel_pstate driver, frequency ranges may not always be  \r\nrespected. The driver may not idle at the proper frequencies all the time.  \r\nVarious bugs can occur.\r\n\r\nAnd that's okay.\r\n\r\npstate-frequency works to deliver convenience, it helps the user configure the \r\nintel_pstate driver to run as they would like it to. It is a simple program.  \r\nIt has a simple task and a simple goal.  Written in simple shell script, it depends only on the  \r\nGNU coreutils and the users ability to read and comprehend the various options  \r\navailable.\r\n\r\nFollow pyamsoft around the Web for updates and announcements about the  \r\nnewest applications!\r\n\r\nLike what I do?\r\n\r\nSend me an email at: pyam.soft@gmail.com  \r\nOr find me online at: http://pyamsoft.blogspot.com/",
